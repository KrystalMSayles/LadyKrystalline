**Why Lady Krystalline?**<br>
It's my gamer tag I originally made up for Steam. I liked the name, so I kept it!<br><br>
I currently work in tech support for a software platform company. I am a graudtate of Full Sail University's Mobile Development program. I have experience with primarily SwiftUI and Android Java. I also have experience with HTML and CSS for web development. I've spent the past few years with a NaaS company where my role had minimal focus on software development. Now that I'm back into my industry of study/choice, I am taking action to update this profile and re-create previous work based on my own designs.
